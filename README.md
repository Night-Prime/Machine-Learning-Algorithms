# # Machine Learning Algorithms 

-Practicing with Tensorflow

Tips to use this Project:
1. Set up a python virtual environment, use 'source <pathname>' to activate.
2. Install the required Python resources mostly pip, ipykernel, and installing these resources into the virtual environment.
3. Install Jupyter and set up on Text editor

Enjoy tweaking these algorithms and play around with ML, Neural Networks and Deep Learning.

# Project 1- Linear Regression Alg.
- building a predictive model for who can survive on the titanic
